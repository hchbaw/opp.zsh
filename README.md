### Important

This code is **obsolete** for zsh-5.0.8 and greater.  zsh-5.0.8 comes with much
more features out-of-box.

Thank you very much, Bram Moolenaar!

I want to use Vim’s text-objects in Zsh.

To use this,

1. source this file.

        % source opp.zsh

2. If you wish to load the extensions, source them afterward.

        % source opp/*.zsh

**Note** This plugin overwrites some bindings within the vicmd-keymap (details below).

*Optionally* you can use the zcompiled file with the autoloading for a little faster loading on every shell startup, if you zcompile the necessary functions.

1. Prepare zcompiling the defined functions and the install command.

        % OS=(~/path/to/opp.zsh/{opp.zsh,opp/*.zsh})

2. If you have some `opp/surround.zsh`’s configurations, those configurations could be zcompiled at this point. Assuming you have such a configuration file in `~/.zsh/opp-surround.zsh`, you could do this.

        % OS=(~/path/to/opp.zsh/{opp.zsh,opp/*.zsh} ~/.zsh/opp-surround.zsh(N))

3. Generate the `~/.zsh/zfunc/{opp,opp-install}.zwc`.

        % (zsh -c "for O in $OS;do . $O;done && opp-zcompile $OS[1] ~/.zsh/zfunc"

   Set up an autoload clause appropriately.

        % { . ~/.zsh/zfunc/opp-install; opp-install }
        % autoload opp

**Note:** This script replaces the following vicmd key map entries: `c`, `d`, `g~`, `gu`, `gU` and `y`. Please be aware of that, since this means that if you set bindings manually or even reset them after sourcing this plugin by using

        % bindkey -d

this plugin will not work.
